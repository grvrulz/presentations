## Disability — Challenges
{:.shout}
// One in every six persons in Asia and the Pacific has some form of disability: 650 million men, women and children. There are around 285 million visually impaired people in the world, out of which around 38-39 million are completely blind. One interesting fact is that over 15 million of blind people are from India, and similarly a large number is from different developing or undeveloped countries, and poor socioeconomic status.


## What is the solution?
{:.shout}
// Obviously enough, computers and the internet can play a huge role in helping people gain knowledge, skills, and the means to lead a better life.

## What is accessibility?

1. …The state of being able to be easily accessed by anyone.
2. …The technological means to reach such state.
3. …The socioeconomic framework to reach such state.


## **Where do we fall short**
// Software and hardware that costs thousands of dollars. When people in rich countries can't afford the tech, how can we expect people in not-so-fortunate parts of the world to be able to, especially with the exchange rates.

## Role of Free Software

1. …Easily accessible
2. …Low cost
3. …Possibility of improvement by community
4. …Educational avenues
5. …Independence from large foreign corporations
6. …Most importantly, easy to fund and support for governments of under-developed economies.



## What do we have
- …Screen readers and TTS engines for the visually impaired
- …Easier navigation and input methods for the motor impaired
- …What more?
